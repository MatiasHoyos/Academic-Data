This file contains infromation regarding the Princeton class of 96Â´ SAT, GPA in High School, GPA in college freshman year, and gender.
Im looking at the GPA scores from which I created a frequency chart and obtained the mean, median, and standard deviation.
This is an academic data set obtained from a profesor from Dartmouth College.
